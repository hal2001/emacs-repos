;;; recursive-narrow.el --- Adds commands that replace narrow-to-region and widen
;;; commands to operate recursively.

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; This package defines two functions, recursive-narrow-to-region and
;; recursive-widen that replace the builtin functions narrow-to-region and
;; widen. These functions operate the same way, except in the case of multiple
;; calls to recursive-narrow-to-region. In this case, recursive-widen will go
;; to the previous buffer visibility, not make the entire buffer visible.

;;; Installation:

;; To install, put this file somewhere in your load-path and add the following
;; to your .emacs file:
;;
;; (require 'recursive-narrow)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x n n") 'recursive-narrow-to-region)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x n w") 'recursive-widen)
;;
