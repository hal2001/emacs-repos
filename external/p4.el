;;p4.el provides commands for interacting with the Perforce Version Control system.  This perforce package is not
;;integrated with emacs' vc package, and so you must use non-standard commands.  This has some drawbacks if you
;;habitually use more than one version control system, but it also allows much greater control.

;;(require 'p4)
