;;icomplete+ is an extension to [[icomplete]].  It adds display for the number of completions possible for the given
;;stem.  It also redefines some of the icomplete faces in order to make each part of the completion - the stem,
;;suffixes, and keybindings - more distinguished.

(require 'icomplete+)
